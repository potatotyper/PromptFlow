PromptFlow is built with Ruby on Rails and Llama-3.3 and Gemma-9b. Ruby on Rails platform acts as a front-end and back-end server. Managing both user interactions and inter-platform communication. We use Llama-3.3 and Gemma-9b to optimize system prompts based on the user inputs collected by Ruby on Rails from any chat system. PromptFlow is a service that is built to be compatible with any chat system. To demonstrate this, we also made a sample chat system that a customer would use. The sample chat system we build it made with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind that leverages Groqcloud as our simple conversational chatbot API.
